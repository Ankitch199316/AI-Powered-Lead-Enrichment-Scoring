## üß≠ Why I Built This

With 6 years of experience across **sales, business development, and revenue leadership roles** ‚Äî including 3+ years in **team leadership and strategy**, I‚Äôve spent thousands of hours watching talented teams get buried under:

- repetitive qualification calls
- scattered CRM notes
- manual outreach copy-paste
- forgotten follow-ups and missed timing

This project was born out of that frustration ‚Äî but also opportunity.

I wanted to **build something that represents the future of sales**:  
> A hands-off AI system that can score leads, research them online, personalize outreach, and even hit ‚ÄúSend‚Äù ‚Äî while your team focuses on closing.

### üíº What It Handles:

- Uses AI to **score and qualify** each lead (Agent 1)
- Researches company data using the web (Agent 2)
- Personalizes outreach with pain points and positioning (Agent 2)
- Generates a professional cold email (Agent 3)
